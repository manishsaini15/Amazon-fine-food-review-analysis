Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (Rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).


[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?

[Ans] We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.
Loading the data
The dataset is available in two forms

.csv file
SQLite Database
In order to load the data, We have used the SQLITE dataset as it easier to query the data and visualise the data efficiently.
Here as we only want to get the global sentiment of the recommendations (positive or negative), we will purposefully ignore all Scores equal to 3. If the score id above 3, then the recommendation wil be set to "positive". Otherwise, it will be set to "negative".
